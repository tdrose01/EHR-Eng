# Server Management Best Practices

## EHR Server Manager

- Use the `start_ehr_servers.py` script to start all components of the EHR system with proper port management
- The server manager automatically kills any processes using required ports (8000, 8004, 8081)
- All server components start in the correct order with proper environment variables
- Press Ctrl+C to gracefully shut down all services
- For Windows users, `start_ehr.bat` provides a double-clickable solution
- For Linux/macOS users, use `./start_ehr.sh` (make it executable first with `chmod +x start_ehr.sh`)
- Server logs are consolidated and saved in the `logs` directory with timestamps

## Port Allocation Guidelines

- Main API server runs on port 8000
- Vaccine API server runs on port 8004
- Frontend development server runs on port 8081
- Avoid manual configuration of ports to prevent conflicts
- The server manager script handles all port management

## Development Workflow

1. Always use the server manager script instead of starting services individually
2. Check the logs directory for detailed server logs if issues occur
3. Ensure PostgreSQL is running before starting the EHR system
4. Test vaccine functionality by:
   - Creating a new medical record
   - Selecting "Vaccination" as the record type
   - Using the vaccine selection dropdown and other vaccine data fields
   - Testing the "Calculate" button for next dose dates
   
## Common Issues and Solutions

- If you encounter port conflicts, use the server manager which automatically frees required ports
- If PostgreSQL connection fails, verify database credentials in the `.env` file
- For CORS issues, make sure all services are running and using the configured ports
- If "Failed to load dashboard statistics" appears, check if the main API server is running

# Lessons Learned from MCP PostgreSQL Testing

## Database Configuration and Setup

- PostgreSQL connection string format: `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/ehr_test`
- Always check if the PostgreSQL server is running before running tests with `pg_isready`
- The MCP tests require specific database tables: `patients`, `records`, and `users`
- Running both the PostgreSQL server and other HTTP services on the same machine can cause port conflicts

## Schema and Data Structure

- The database schema uses a single `name` field rather than separate `firstName`/`lastName` fields
- Database column names don't always match the frontend model property names (e.g., `name` vs `firstName`/`lastName`)
- Always check the actual schema before writing assertions by using `SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'patients'`
- Add an inspection test to analyze the format of database records before writing detailed assertions

## Test Structure Best Practices

- Use safe assertions when testing database schema (e.g., check if a column exists before asserting it)
- Don't rely on LIMIT/OFFSET working exactly as expected in test environments - results may vary
- Add proper error handling and database cleanup after tests
- Add detailed logging of database query results for debugging purposes
- Separate test setup from test assertions for better maintainability
- Include schema verification steps before running database-dependent tests
- Mock network errors explicitly to test fallback behavior

## Common Issues and Solutions

- Network errors in console output are often informational and don't necessarily indicate test failures
- Path resolution problems can be fixed by using correct import paths relative to project structure
- Authentication token is required for API requests and must be properly set in headers
- Use explicit WHERE clauses in SQL queries (e.g., `table_schema = 'public'`) to avoid ambiguous results
- When tests fail due to missing properties, first check if the property exists in the schema
- Placeholder components can solve import errors in the router configuration
- Differences between unit test mocks and actual database schema cause most test failures
- Tests pass with expected errors when those errors are part of the test design

## Performance Considerations

- PostgreSQL settings to check: max_connections, shared_buffers, effective_cache_size
- Average query time around 2.5ms with cache hit ratio of 0.98 is good performance
- Use smaller batches for data import/export operations
- Dev server instances can accumulate and consume ports (8080-8090+)

## Test Command Structure

- Individual test commands like `npm run test:mcp:patient-search` are more useful for debugging
- Full test suite can be run with `npm run test:mcp`
- Database setup and teardown should be part of the test process
- Test commands should be documented in a README or dedicated testing document

## Vue Application Structure

- When files are referenced in router configuration but don't exist in the project, the app will fail to start
- Check for missing route component files by examining the router configuration (router/index.js)
- Create placeholder components for routes that are defined but don't have corresponding view files
- For external resources (like images), use reliable sources or placeholder services (e.g., https://via.placeholder.com)
- The development server will attempt to use alternative ports if the default ones (5173, 8080) are already in use
- When creating new Vue components, follow the existing project structure and styling conventions
- Use Base64-encoded images when actual image files aren't available or during initial development

## API and Services

- Check for missing services when import statements reference services that don't exist (e.g., `dashboardService` in api.js)
- Implement fallback data or mock responses in service functions to handle API errors gracefully
- Return properly formatted mock data to match the expected structure of API responses
- Always include error handling in service functions to prevent app crashes when APIs are unavailable
- Use environment variables for API endpoints to make the app configurable for different environments
- Keep token naming consistent across the application (e.g., using 'ehrToken' everywhere)
- Provide fallback credentials for testing environments
- Fix infinite loading spinner issues by ensuring API responses are properly normalized and validated before use
- Don't delay loading critical data with setTimeout as it can cause UI elements to remain in loading state indefinitely
- Add detailed logging to troubleshoot API response format mismatches
- Always check for null and undefined before accessing properties of API responses
- Implement timeout mechanisms for loading spinners to provide user feedback when operations take too long
- When using v-for with v-else conditions, ensure the v-else is properly placed on the containing element not individual list items

## Development Environment

- Kill unused development servers to prevent port exhaustion
- Use `lsof -i :8080` (Linux/Mac) or `netstat -ano | findstr :8080` (Windows) to find processes using specific ports
- Document the expected state of external services (PostgreSQL, API servers) needed for testing
- Keep test data consistent between unit tests and integration tests to avoid confusion
- When running both an API server and a dev server, configure CORS or use a proxy in development

## UI Components

- Add built-in timeout handling to reusable loading components to prevent them from getting stuck
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed operations to enhance user experience
- Use defensive programming in computed properties to handle edge cases (empty arrays, null values)
- Validate data before performing operations like sorting or pagination to prevent errors
- Include detailed console logging during development to help trace issues with component rendering
- Always provide fallback content when data might be unavailable (e.g., 'N/A' for missing fields)
- Reset pagination to page 1 when filters or data sources change to avoid invalid page states
- When implementing search functionality, use both event handlers: `@input` with debounce for typing and `@keyup.enter` for immediate search on Enter key press
- Use `.stop` modifier with click events in table rows to prevent row click from triggering when clicking on buttons or checkboxes within the row
- Make table actions (view, edit, delete) visually distinct with appropriate colors that match the app's theme
- Implement a "staged" approach to potentially destructive operations (like delete) with a confirmation dialog
- Export functionality should use the browser's native download capabilities via Blob and URL.createObjectURL()
- When implementing tables with selectable rows, maintain a separate array for selected items rather than modifying the original data

## Testing Strategies

- For component testing, ensure all event handlers are properly emitted and captured
- When testing table components, verify sorting, filtering, and pagination functionality independently
- Test user interactions (clicks, keyboard events) on all interactive elements
- Mock API responses with both success and error scenarios to ensure graceful error handling
- For export functionality, verify the correct format and content of exported data
- Test that confirmation dialogs appear for destructive operations and respect user choices
- Verify that styling is consistent across different states (loading, empty, error, populated)

## Database Field Handling Best Practices

- Empty strings should be handled with consistent parameterized queries instead of conditional SQL generation
- Parameter indexing in SQL queries must be maintained even when handling special cases
- For fields that need to accept empty strings, avoid conditional SQL like `fmpc = ''` and instead use parameterized queries
- When updating multiple fields, keep parameter indexing consistent to avoid off-by-one errors
- Use the correct connection string format: `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres`
- Create setup scripts that verify database connection, schema, and core functionality
- Always test edge cases like empty strings, nulls, and special characters in database fields
- PostgreSQL treats empty strings and NULL values differently - be explicit about which one you want to use
- For debugging database issues, create targeted test scripts that isolate the specific functionality
- When using multiple services (main API, dedicated service), ensure consistent database handling across all services

## Patient Edit Functionality Fixes

- The PatientEdit component must explicitly handle both camelCase and snake_case properties (both `bloodType` and `blood_type`)
- When updating patient data, ensure critical fields like FMPC, blood type, and allergies are explicitly included in the update data
- For reliable updates, reflect server response data back to the UI component after successful update
- Add comprehensive logging of field values before and after save operations to diagnose update issues
- When working with form fields, ensure binding uses the correct property names that match the component's data model
- Use separate API test scripts to validate that backend updates are working correctly before debugging UI issues
- Test field refreshing on multiple fields to ensure all updates are properly reflected in the UI
- For consistent field handling, maintain both camelCase and snake_case versions of all fields throughout the application

## Add Patient Functionality Testing

- The Add Patient button is correctly implemented across the application with routes properly configured
- The route `/patients/add` reuses the PatientEdit component with an `isNew=true` prop to distinguish create vs edit mode
- The MCP server testing revealed the patient creation API works correctly and handles normalized fields appropriately
- Form submission properly normalizes data between camelCase and snake_case field names before sending to the API
- For UI testing, it's essential to try multiple port numbers (8080-8085) as Vite development servers create new ports when previous ones are in use
- Frontend screenshots are essential for debugging UI interactions during testing, especially for form submissions
- The patient creation API handles all required fields properly and returns the newly created patient with an assigned ID
- When testing Add Patient functionality, it's important to clean up test data by deleting created patients after verification
- Using consistent field naming conventions between frontend and backend prevents most patient creation issues
- The MCP environment properly handles all edge cases for patient record creation including special characters in fields

### MCP Server Integration Summary for Patient Create/Edit

- The MCP PostgreSQL server correctly stores and retrieves patient data with all fields properly preserved
- Successful integration testing requires a combination of API-level tests and UI interaction tests with Playwright
- When a patient is created through the UI, the database properly assigns an ID and all fields match what was submitted in the form
- Special fields like FMPC, blood type, and allergies are correctly handled by both the API and database
- The data flow from form submission through API to database and back works correctly across all fields
- Comprehensive logging in the server shows proper field normalization between camelCase and snake_case formats
- When form fields use snake_case (like `first_name`) but the API expects camelCase (like `firstName`), the preparePatientData function ensures compatibility
- Manual testing with visual browser validation provides the most comprehensive verification of the entire patient creation workflow

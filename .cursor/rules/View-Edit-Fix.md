# Patient View/Edit Functionality Fix

## Issue Description

The view and edit buttons in the Dashboard and PatientList components were not correctly routing to the appropriate pages due to incorrect URL paths in the router navigation functions.

### Specific Problems Found

1. In the `Dashboard.vue` component, the router navigation URLs were incorrectly formed:
   - `viewPatient` was navigating to `/patients/{id}` instead of `/patients/view/{id}`
   - `editPatient` was navigating to `/patients/{id}/edit` instead of `/patients/edit/{id}`

2. In both components, there was insufficient error handling and logging around the navigation actions, making it difficult to diagnose issues.

3. The navigation functions weren't checking for valid patient IDs before attempting navigation.

## Implemented Fixes

### Dashboard Component

1. Updated the `viewPatient` method to use the correct URL format:
   ```javascript
   const viewPatient = (patientId) => {
     router.push(`/patients/view/${patientId}`);
   }
   ```

2. Updated the `editPatient` method to use the correct URL format:
   ```javascript
   const editPatient = (patientId) => {
     router.push(`/patients/edit/${patientId}`);
   }
   ```

3. Added comprehensive error handling and logging:
   - Added validation for patient IDs
   - Added try/catch blocks around router navigation
   - Added detailed console logging
   - Added user-friendly error alerts when navigation fails

### PatientList Component

1. Enhanced the `handlePatientRowClick`, `viewPatient`, and `editPatient` methods with improved error handling and logging:
   - Added try/catch blocks around router navigation
   - Added more detailed console logging
   - Added user-friendly error alerts when navigation fails

## Testing

Created comprehensive Playwright test scripts to validate the view and edit functionality across the application:

1. `tests/manual-dashboard-test.js` - Tests view/edit navigation from the Dashboard
2. `tests/view-edit-test.js` - Tests view/edit navigation from both Dashboard and PatientList

These tests help verify that:
- View buttons correctly navigate to the patient view page
- Edit buttons correctly navigate to the patient edit page
- The application properly handles invalid patient IDs and navigation errors

## Lessons Learned

1. **Consistent Route Naming**: Ensure route paths in router.js match the paths used in components.

2. **Error Handling**: Always include proper error handling around navigation functions.

3. **Validation**: Validate IDs and other parameters before attempting navigation.

4. **Comprehensive Logging**: Add detailed logging to simplify debugging.

5. **Automated Testing**: Create automated tests to validate critical navigation paths.

By implementing these fixes, the view and edit functionality now works correctly across the application.

[Cursor] Implement PatientList component with Cypress tests

Added comprehensive patient list functionality including:
- Responsive PatientTable component with sorting, filtering, and pagination
- Search functionality with debounced input
- Service filter dropdown
- Export selected patients as JSON
- Action buttons (View, Edit, Delete) with confirmation
- End-to-end tests with Cypress
- Component tests for PatientTable and PatientList
- Loading and error states with fallback data
- Updated documentation in Lessons.md

Note: Cypress tests are passing for component tests. End-to-end tests 
require a running server on port 8086 to function.

Next steps:
- Fix any remaining end-to-end test issues
- Implement patient detail view
- Add form validation for patient creation/editing

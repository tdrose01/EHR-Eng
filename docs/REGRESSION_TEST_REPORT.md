# Regression Test Report

## System: Electronic Health Record (EHR)

### Test Date: Updated through June 2023

## Executive Summary

The regression testing for the EHR system has been completed with a comprehensive focus on both API functionality and frontend integration. The tests revealed several critical issues which have been addressed:

1. Database configuration mismatches
2. API route discrepancies 
3. ASGI/WSGI compatibility issues
4. Server process management problems
5. Environment configuration misalignments
6. Records API column naming convention mismatches

All identified issues have been successfully resolved, and all key system functions are now operating as expected.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Database Configuration Issues

**Problem**: Database configuration parameters were inconsistent between development and testing environments.

**Resolution**: Configuration files have been synchronized, and a centralized `.env` file approach has been implemented for consistency.

### 2. API Route Discrepancies

**Problem**: Several API endpoints, particularly for patient search and authentication, had different path structures in the documentation vs. implementation.

**Resolution**: All API routes have been standardized and updated in both the implementation and documentation.

### 3. ASGI/WSGI Compatibility 

**Problem**: The async capabilities of the server were not being properly utilized for database operations.

**Resolution**: Updated server configuration to ensure proper async/await patterns are used throughout the application.

### 4. Server Process Management

**Problem**: Development server processes were not being properly terminated, causing port conflicts.

**Resolution**: Implemented proper process management with signal handlers for graceful shutdowns.

### 5. Environment Configuration

**Problem**: Environment variables were not being properly loaded in all contexts.

**Resolution**: Standardized environment variable loading using `python-dotenv` in all contexts.

### 6. Records API Database Schema Mismatch

**Problem**: The records table used camelCase column names (e.g., "patientId") while the API was accessing them using snake_case (e.g., "patient_id").

**Resolution**: Updated the records_api.py file to properly reference column names in the correct format. Modified:
- All instances of `r.patient_id` to `r."patientId"`
- Fixed JOIN conditions and WHERE clauses
- Removed references to non-existent columns
- Updated INSERT and UPDATE statements with correct column names

## Testing Framework

The regression test suite consisted of the following:

### Database Setup Testing

* Connection verification
* Schema validation
* Data integrity checks
* Indexing performance assessment

### API Testing

* Patients API endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
* Records API endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
* Authentication endpoints
* Search functionality
* Error handling

### Frontend-Backend Integration

* API service consumption
* Error handling and display
* Data rendering consistency
* Form submission processes

### Browser Automation Testing

* Patient listing
* Patient details viewing
* Medical record management
* Form validation
* Navigation flow

## Validation Summary

**Test Type** | **Pass Rate** | **Notes**
--- | --- | ---
Database | 100% | All connections successful
Patient API | 100% | All endpoints operational
Records API | 100% | All endpoints operational after column name fixes
Authentication | 100% | Token generation and validation working
Frontend Integration | 100% | All components render correctly with API data
Browser Tests | 100% | User flows operating as expected

## Recommendations

1. Implement continuous integration testing for the API endpoints
2. Add more comprehensive validation for user inputs
3. Expand test coverage for edge cases, especially in patient search
4. Consider adding performance benchmarks for API response times
5. Review and standardize column naming conventions in the database schema
6. Add data validation layers between frontend and backend

## Conclusion

The system has successfully passed all regression tests after the implementation of the fixes mentioned above. The application is stable and ready for the next phase of development.

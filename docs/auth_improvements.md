# Authorization System Improvements

## Security Enhancements

1. **Password Hashing**
   - Replaced SHA-256 with bcrypt for password hashing
   - Added salt to prevent rainbow table attacks
   - Implemented proper password verification

2. **Session Management**
   - Created a dedicated sessions table in the database
   - Added session expiration
   - Implemented secure cookie settings (HttpOnly, SameSite)
   - Added logout functionality to invalidate sessions

3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Implemented a permission system based on user roles
   - Created different roles with specific permissions:
     - Admin: Full access to all features
     - Doctor: Can read and write patient data
     - Nurse: Can only read patient data
     - User: No access to patient data
   - Added permission checks for all API endpoints

## Database Improvements

1. **PostgreSQL Integration**
   - Migrated from SQLite to PostgreSQL for better scalability
   - Added proper database schema with constraints
   - Created indexes for better query performance

2. **Data Handling**
   - Added custom JSON encoder to handle date objects
   - Improved error handling for database operations

## Code Quality

1. **Modularization**
   - Separated database functions into a dedicated module
   - Created helper functions for common tasks

2. **Security Best Practices**
   - Added input validation for user registration
   - Implemented password strength requirements
   - Used parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

## Testing

1. **Authentication Testing**
   - Created test scripts to verify login functionality
   - Added tests for session management

2. **Authorization Testing**
   - Implemented comprehensive RBAC tests
   - Verified permission enforcement for different user roles

## Next Steps

1. **Additional Security Features**
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
   - Add two-factor authentication
   - Implement password reset functionality

2. **Audit Logging**
   - Add logging for security-related events
   - Track login attempts and authorization failures

3. **Token-Based Authentication**
   - Consider implementing JWT for API authentication
   - Add refresh token functionality
